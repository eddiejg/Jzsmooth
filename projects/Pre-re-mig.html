		<h2><p>Mindjet Introduces Mindjet ProjectDirector To Offer Businesses Purpose-Driven, Project-Based Collaboration</p></h2>
		<p><em>Putting Ideas To Work: Collaborative project management suite empowers teams to work together and drive results collectively, from idea to successful completion</em></p>
		<p><strong>San Francisco, CA &ndash; June 18, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Today <a href="/">Mindjet</a> introduced Mindjet ProjectDirector™, a unified project management suite for teams. Mindjet ProjectDirector combines Mindjet’s mind mapping and planning capabilities, file management, and task management to give teams a way to collaborate on projects throughout the duration of a project – from brainstorming on goals and gaining buy-in to managing through execution. ProjectDirector includes a virtual project management startup experience where the user is led through the step-by-step process of creating and defining a project, allowing everyone on the team to actively participate in all phases of an initiative, from idea to successful completion.</p>
		<p>Mindjet ProjectDirector will be released soon. To be the first to experience the latest project management software from Mindjet, <a href="/products/projectdirector">click here</a> and sign up. Spread the news on Facebook and Twitter for insider access. </p>
		<p><strong>Project Management For Everyone on Your Team</strong><br>
		In today’s changing workplace, organizations are expected to be more <a href="/our-perspective/">agile</a> than ever and most everyone plays the role of project manager. Teams are often decentralized, cross-functional and formed to address specific problems, so projects are managed by an array of people, not just specialized project managers. With traditional project managers taking on more extensive duties, other team members are expected to take on a project management-focused role, which requires readily available tools to quickly and effectively do this.</p>
		<p>By providing all project contributors with a clear purpose and end goal, Mindjet ProjectDirector has improved project planning while also reimagining how people share and co-edit tasks to enable more efficient communication and practical decision-making. This approach gets what’s important out front – your ideas – and provides deep insight into deadlines and project status, ultimately taking a project from idea all the way to successful completion.</p>
		<p>“Mindjet enhances the ability of my business users to focus on the tasks at hand without losing sight of the big picture or missing out on opportunities for meaningful, project-based collaboration,” said Robert Spielvogel, CTO at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcVHg5pIxBI">Educational Development Center, Inc.</a> “This translates into providing more overall value to our customers and partners.”</p>
		<p><strong>Mindjet Cloud Integration</strong><br>

    			<h2><p>Mindjet Introduces MindManager 14 for Windows, the Most Powerful Version to Date</p></h2>
    			<p><em>MindManager 14 for Windows Boosts Productivity and Planning with Extensive New Features and Capabilities Added to Leading Mind Mapping Software</em></p>
    			<p><strong>San Francisco, CA &ndash; September 12, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Today <a href="/">Mindjet</a> announced the public availability of <a href="/mindmanager">MindManager 14</a> for Windows, the most powerful version of the company’s desktop productivity software. With an expanded feature set that enables increased productivity, MindManager 14 helps today’s hurried business professionals keep their projects on track and on time. MindManager 14 is the most flexible, intuitive way to visually brainstorm ideas, organize information, develop actionable strategies and communicate results.</p>
    			<p>MindManager is the leading mind mapping and business planning software used by over two million professionals within 83 percent of the Fortune 100. MindManager allows you to map your ideas and information visually, starting with a central idea or topic surrounded by subtopics or "branches”. The MindManager map is a visual information diagram that communicates the creator's thoughts with the benefits of interactive embedded data, live hyperlinks, collaboration capabilities, project management features and much more.</p>
    			<p>MindManager 14 for Windows helps address the top three critical innovation and operational concerns listed in The Conference Board’s 2013 Survey on Executive Challenges (see chart below):</p>
    			<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="5">
    				<tr>
    					<td width="50%"><strong>CEO Concern:</td>
    					<td width="50%"><strong>Leading Strategy to Address Concern:</strong></td>

    					<td width="50%">Apply new technologies (product, process, information, etc.)</td>
    				</tr>
    			</table>
    			<br>
    			<p>According to that study, these challenges can be effectively addressed by increasing employee productivity, a hallmark benefit of MindManager technology.</p>
    			<p>"Each year, we identify thousands of insights and strategic opportunities across a range of industries," said Steve Schwartz, co-founder & vice president of The Inovo Group, an innovation consulting company. "Mindjet’s visualization and planning capabilities form the backbone of how we turn those opportunities into innovation that benefits our customers, like Exxon Mobil, UnitedHealth Group, Nestlé Purina and has led us to hundreds of millions of dollars in new business."</p>
    			<p><strong>New Features to Enhance Productivity and Planning</strong><br>
    			MindManager 14 for Windows builds upon Mindjet’s industry-leading information mapping capabilities and includes enhanced individual productivity and planning features so that individuals and teams can accomplish more while being more creative and at the same time, ensure project success and improve communication by organizing and presenting information in a visual context.</p>
    			<p>MindManager’s new features improve the ability of businesses to make better decisions, innovate and drive growth by enabling users to build a more accurate view of the underlying structure of complex problems or projects.</p>
    			<p>New feature highlights include:</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Comprehensive Business Planning & Budgeting Capabilities: Build formulas directly into the map to dramatically expand the quantitative capabilities to help drive your business. Includes advanced quantitative features to analyze costs, benefits, risks, and other numerical data for better and easier budgeting, sales forecasting, portfolio management, event planning and cost/benefit analysis.</li>
    				<li>Dynamic Dashboards: Visual decision-making and “what-if” analysis via conditional formatting enables users to automatically color code and highlight topics based on preset criteria and thresholds. Users can now better visualize opportunities and risks for better decisions.</li>
    				<li>Major Usability Enhancements: Improved usability, including a perfected map index pane for “at-a-glance” organization and views of detailed map information. New drag-and-drop enhancements to easily move files, images and attachments from other maps, the desktop, online folders and Outlook®, providing the quickest management of project-related documents and files.</li>
    			</ul>
    			<p>"Businesses routinely rank productivity and innovation as top business priorities, while at the same time struggling to find better ways of making decisions and improving their employees’ output," said Mindjet Chief Marketing Officer Jascha Kaykas-Wolff. "MindManager 14 gives individuals and teams a powerful visual whiteboard to clearly understand the impact of new ideas and initiatives, plan for success and see their projects through to completion. Our goal with MindManager 14 is nothing short of dramatically improving an organization’s creativity, project planning, performance and innovation."</p>
    			<p>MindManager 14 complements the project management capabilities of Mindjet’s other products, such as the recently launched <a href="/projectdirector">ProjectDirector</a>, a complete online software suite that helps businesses take ideas through to project completion.</p>

<div class="press-release" style="padding-top:20px;">
    			<h2><p>Mindjet and Spigit Merge to Advance Repeatable Business Innovation</p></h2>
    			<p><em>The Global Leaders in Project-based Collaboration and Enterprise Innovation Join Forces to Create the First Business Platform that Delivers Real Business Results.</em></p>
	            <p><strong>San Francisco, CA &ndash; September 16, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mindjet.com">Mindjet<sup>®</sup></a>, the leader in project-based collaboration software, and <a href="http://www.spigit.com">Spigit<sup>®</sup></a>, the leading innovation management platform, announced their merger creating the first business platform that effectively manages innovation from idea creation to opportunity selection to project completion.</p>

	            <p>Mindjet is used by 83% of the Fortune 100<sup>&trade;</sup>, and over two million global users, to brainstorm and plan on virtual whiteboards, create and co-edit plans, share files, and keep everyone on the same page with real-time task &amp; project management. In 2012 Mindjet was the most awarded collaboration company, winning eight high-profile awards. Nearly two million users worldwide and over 3,000 companies, including leading brands across retail, healthcare, financial, technology, government, insurance, utilities and pharmaceutical industries use Spigit to make innovation a mission critical, repeatable, predictable and quantifiable business process. In 2012, Inc. Magazine listed Spigit as the #1 fastest growing private software company in California. Spigit continued to build upon its momentum in 2013 with record revenue growth and <a href="http://www.spigit.com/blog/independent-research-firm-cites-spigit-as-a-leader-in-its-recent-report/" target="_blank">Forrester identified Spigit as a leader in Innovation Management.</a></p>

	            <p>The combination of Mindjet and Spigit will create the first enterprise platform that drives business results through repeatable business innovation. According to a recent survey conducted by Bain &amp; Company, two-thirds of executives at companies generating over $100 million in revenue named innovation as one of their top three priorities. Yet, in that same survey, less than a quarter of the same executives believed their companies were effective innovators. In a similar Accenture survey of large enterprise executives, 70% ranked innovation among their top five business priorities and said that a holistic process is key to successful outcomes. Today’s companies require a software platform that goes beyond social business in the workplace and helps them integrate innovation into their business processes to grow their business. Mindjet and Spigit help companies innovate to identify their best ideas and then manage those opportunities to completion.</p>
			
				<p>Social Business needs to go beyond simple communication for employee involvement. Unlike previous generations of Social Business software, the expanded offerings supports the full <a href="/spigit/vision-to-action/">Vision to Action™ Lifecycle</a>, allowing businesses to manage innovation from ideas through successful completion. Businesses can use crowdsourcing, mind mapping, big data analytics and game mechanics technology to surface and develop the very best ideas, and then bring those ideas to market with a purpose-driven project management suite.</p>
			
				<p>Following the merger, Mindjet and Spigit will integrate and Spigit's executive team will assume leadership roles within the newly expanded Mindjet organization led by Mindjet CEO Scott Raskin.</p>

	              <p>“The expanded Mindjet will help us solve some of the problems facing our organization.

At the same time we are trying to forge a common, unifying culture across the many silos created by the nature of our project-driven work. The merged strengths of these products provide a tangible way to address this need.”</p>

	              <p>"Social business solutions should provide the ability to capture insight, intelligently filter information and deliver it into action in the business.

    			<p><em>Latest innovation management release adds powerful, intelligent social features, providing a deeply personal experience to optimize business outcomes</em></p>
    			<p><strong>San Francisco, CA &ndash; October 1, 2013 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;<a href="/">Mindjet</a>, , the leading innovation management and collaborative project 
    			management platform, today announced the new release of <a href="http://www.spigit.com/products/spigitengage/">Spigit Engage.</a> Loaded with purposeful social features, the newest version of Spigit Engage better connects employees to innovation programs for stronger business outcomes. </p>
    			
    			<p>Mindjet’s latest release features powerful new ways to work including a personal innovation hub where users can get a single view of all activity, open challenges and trending ideas. 
    			A new activity stream that allows users to interact with ideas across company-wide innovation initiatives and a unified inbox collects and displays all private messages, social @mentions and assigned tasks. </p>
    			<p>"Our research shows that the #1 issue CEOs face today is innovation. Offerings such as the new Spigit Engage helps enterprises find the best ideas and takes them through to execution – a huge advantage for companies looking to leapfrog the competition,” 
    			said Jim Lundy, CEO and Principal Analyst at Aragon Research. “The personal innovation hub in Spigit Engage helps surface opportunities that are highly relevant for businesses.”</p>
    			
    		    <p><strong>New features in Spigit Engage</strong></p>
    		    <p><strong>Personal Innovation Hub:</strong> Employees remain more engaged when innovation is a fundamental part of the culture and part of everyone’s job.  
    		    Their ideas lead to visible outcomes that would not otherwise have been possible- reinforcing and motivating continued participation. 
    		    The Personal Innovation Hub has been built to make innovation relevant to each employee, increasing participation in “challenges” and providing a wider net of ideas. With more ideas in the pipeline, companies receive more positive outcomes. 
    		    The Personal Innovation Hub includes:</p>
    			<ul>
    				<li><strong>Activity Streams:</strong> Rather than a stream of discussions on stray topics, the activity stream surfaces ideas being submitted across the organization via proposed challenges. 
    				Participating in discussions, votes, evaluations and reviews are possible with a single click in the stream.</li>
    				<li><strong>Unified inbox:</strong> Everything comes together in a single view: private messages, social @mentions and notifications of tasks that are assigned to individuals as part of the business workflow.</li>
    				<li><strong>Additional features:</strong> Employees can monitor trending ideas and open challenges in a “challenge carousel”. Also included is Section 508 Compliance for product accessibility and updated mobile apps on the App Store<sup>&trade;</sup> and Google Play<sup>&reg;</sup>.</li>
    			</ul>
    			<br>
    			<p>“The newest version of Spigit Engage introduces key features focused on driving higher participation within company-wide innovation initiatives,” 
    			said Scott Raskin, CEO of Mindjet “Spigit Engage and MindManager are the most powerful product launches in our company’s history and point the way towards a complete business innovation solution that yields superior business results.”</p>

		<h2><p>Work Collaboration Innovator Mindjet Adds New Collaboration Products, Garners Two Million Paid Customers and More Than One Million Mobile Users in 2011</p></h2>
		<strong>Work Collaboration Innovator Mindjet Adds New Collaboration Products, Garners Two Million Paid Customers and More Than One Million Mobile Users in 2011</strong><br /><br /><p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO &ndash; February 7, 2012</strong> &ndash; <a href="/index.html" target="_self">Mindjet</a>&reg; Takes the Collaboration Space with Greater Than 20 Percent Growth, Marquee Enterprise Customers, and Increased Paid User Base</p>
<p>Collaborative Work Management provider Mindjet&reg; recapped 2011 as a momentous year marked by the company&rsquo;s launch into the collaboration space, major product launches and double-digit growth. Mindjet also excelled in the mobile apps space with iOS&reg; and Android&reg; introductions, adding over one million new mobile users.  New product releases <strong>propelled greater than 20 percent increase in booking s and continued sales momentum throughout 2011</strong>, and the signing of marquee customers Bayer, Credit Suisse, Dow Chemical, HSBC, Nokia and Volvo. At the close of the year, Mindjet&rsquo;s paid user base reached two million, including 83 percent of Fortune 100 companies.</p>
<p>According to research by LexisNexis&reg;, 62 percent of workers in every market admit that the quality of their work suffers at times because they cannot sort through the information they need fast enough. Today&rsquo;s increasingly virtual office, running  at a feverish pace, adds to the list of challenges commonly faced by teams &ndash; often leading  to lost productivity, as well as profits. The ability to collaborate, set goals and execute against them requires more than simple document management and file sharing. Singular task management solutions address only the back end of dilemma, making a complete solution that much more critical.</p>
<p>Mindjet Connect&reg;, the platform that helps generate ideas, organize information, and store and share data, is designed specifically to create plans and drive them through execution. Mindjet added critical task management capabilities to the platform in late summer 2011 through its acquisition of Cohuman&reg;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2011 was a pivotal year for us,&rdquo; said Mindjet CEO Scott Raskin. &ldquo;Nearly every company I speak with faces challenges creating plans to support their goals and empowering their people to take the right actions in a coordinated fashion.  The ability for teams to visualize and execute on their plans in an accessible and usable environment has flat-out not existed. Mindjet is the first company to bridge the divide. Our financial success in 2011 and healthy user base is proof of market demand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>UNHCR leverages Spigit to drive ideas, innovative solutions to help people of concern to UNHCR worldwide</p>
<p>PLEASANTON, CA – Aug. 12, 2013 &#8211; Spigit, the global leader in enterprise innovation software, today announced that it will be working with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), its partners, and its beneficiaries to solve some of the most pressing challenges in refugee protection and assistance worldwide.</p>

<p>For the past 60 years UNHCR has been the leading agency providing refugees and others of concern with protection and humanitarian assistance. UNHCR Innovation is a multi-year initiative looking for more efficient, effective and creative solutions to challenges faced by refugees across the world, with the goal of enhancing refugee’s protection, empowerment, self-sufficiency and dignity. </p>

<p>UNHCR Ideas, an initiative lead by UNHCR Innovation, will be powered by the <a href="http://www.spigit.com/products/spigitengage/" target="_blank">SpigitEngage</a> platform. The first phase is a six-week challenge that launches today, which asks the UNHCR community – including staff members, partners and academic institutions &#8211; how access to information and services provided by UNHCR and its partners can be improved for refugees living in urban areas.  UNHCR employees and members of partner organizations will then evaluate the top ten ideas and help participants clarify and strengthen their proposals. The winning idea will be piloted in 2014. </p>
 
<p>&#8220;We are excited to launch UNHCR Ideas to better foster collaboration and harvest creativity within UNHCR to help the over 35 million of concern to our organization around the world today,&#8221; said Olivier Delarue, UNHCR Innovation Lead.</p>

<p>“Over the last six decades – and in the face of ongoing emergencies and the rapidly changing world, we have continually adapted and innovated to better enable tens of millions of people restart their lives. Now, using UNHCR Ideas, powered by Spigit, we have the online innovation management platform that truly unites all of UNHCR stakeholders across the globe to address these challenges.” </p>

<p>Spigit’s leading platform will underpin and host specific challenges for UNHCR, activate crowds and enable purposeful social innovation that drives engagement and change. This grassroots approach will identify, validate and implement refugee-centered solutions, bringing together a global community of experts with common goals and experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Innovation is about adapting to the context.  It is often used in the private sector but, with a few exceptions, neglected in humanitarian work. We are honored to help UNHCR tap into the ideas and experiences of its broad ecosystem to solve some of the world’s most life-challenging problems,&#8221; said Shail Khiyara, CMO and Chief Customer Officer at Spigit. </p>

<p>&#8220;Humanitarian innovation can transform lives and Spigit&#8217;s platform fosters a collaborative environment to bring challenges and solutions to light from UNHCR staff on the ground in countries around the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spigit is the innovation engine that drives growth, helping organizations unleash the creativity of its employees, partners and customers. Leveraging crowdsourcing, game mechanics and big data analytics, Spigit works with the world’s leading brands to spark ideas on a scale otherwise impossible, accelerating the rate of innovation.</p>

In line with UNHCR’s mandate, the ultimate goal of UNHCR Innovation is refugee protection, self-reliance, empowerment, dignity and education. To fulfill its mandate, UNHCR Innovation engages staff members to re-thinks the way UNHCR works; the way it involves refugees in the design of the programs and the way it looks at good practices in the humanitarian and private sector world. </p>

     Press Release Migrations: 2012-Sept-18-Spigit Leads Social Innovation 2.0 with Crowdcast Acquistion
/*======================================================================================================*/

<h1>Spigit Leads in Social Innovation 2.0 With Crowdcast Acquisition </h1>
<p><strong>
      <p>Industry Leader Acquires Award Winning Technology to Help Forecast Business Results of Innovation for the First Time</p>
        </strong></p>
<p>
<div class="mw_release">
 <p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwire - Sep 18, 2012) -  Spigit, the global leader in <a href="http://www.spigit.com/solutions/products">Social Innovation Software</a>, today announced it has acquired San Francisco based Crowdcast, the company that defined Social Business Intelligence.&#160;Spigit with Crowdcast transforms innovation into a predictable discipline with the business rigor traditionally associated with Marketing, Accounting, or Sales.&#160;For the first time, leaders can plan, visualize and manage the entire innovation pipeline. </p>
        <p>With Crowdcast, chosen as one of the world's most innovative companies by MIT's Tech Review in 2011, Spigit has the only solution capable of turning ideas into real investment opportunities.&#160;Now companies can use crowd-driven predictive analytics to generate innovative ideas and usher those ideas through to execution with predictable ROI.</p>
        <p>"There is a renaissance underway in the Social Innovation software market," said Paul Pluschkell, Founder and CEO of Spigit.&#160;"Social Innovation 2.0 moves beyond idea capture and into execution.&#160;With the Crowdcast team and technology, we add a critical piece of the innovation process -- leveraging the crowd to determine the return on innovation."</p>
        <p>Social Business Intelligence is ideally suited for tasks historically requiring the manual work of an expensive business analyst or expert such as forecasting product sales or cost estimates.&#160;Spigit's social innovation products with Crowdcast technology can: </p>
        
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Forecast and combine multiple metrics into fundable business cases that leaders can act on directly.
            </li>
<li>Deliver verified estimates leveraging the crowd that are as good as or better than estimates from traditional sources, such as analysts.
            </li>
<li>Manage innovation investment as a portfolio, reducing risk and maximizing returns.&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>"Business leaders seek new tools that can turn innovation insights into monetizable action.&#160;In fact, leaders seek more than just reporting and dashboards, they expect to make real decisions that support business strategy and planning.&#160;New Innovation 2.0 tools bring this potential to reality," said R "Ray" Wang, Principal Analyst and CEO, Constellation Research, Inc.</p>
        <p>"With the addition of Crowdcast, Spigit just upped the ante in the Social Innovation market.&#160;We expect more enterprises to look to Innovation platforms like Spigit to help to enable a quantified Innovation pipeline," said Jim Lundy, Founder and CEO of Aragon Research.</p>
        <p>"Crowdcast is delighted to join forces with Spigit," said Mat Fogarty, Founder and CEO of Crowdcast.&#160;"By combining our visions around innovation and collective intelligence, we have the knowledge and technologies to power Social Innovation 2.0 and fundamentally change the way products move from idea to success."</p>
        <p>Spigit acquired Crowdcast for an undisclosed amount.&#160;As part of the agreement, Spigit will add all of Crowdcast's patents to its portfolio and add Crowdcast's leadership team including Founder/CEO Mat Fogarty and Chief Scientist Leslie Fine to Spigit's executive team.</p>
